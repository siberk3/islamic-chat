#mask_chat.py; An outline for implementing the "Mask IP-address Chat Game Party" using Python's tkinter library.
mask_chat.py:
Create the main window using tkinter:

Set up the window title and dimensions.
Create labels and text boxes to display the live hosts and guests.
Implement the "Who is live" section:

Define variables to store the IP addresses of the host and guests.
Display the host's IP address in the corresponding label.
Display the guest IP addresses in separate labels.
Implement the "Who is not live" section:

Create labels to display the IP addresses of guests who are not live.
Implement the group chat functionality:

Create a text box widget to display the chat messages.
Allow users to enter and submit text in the chat.
Implement logic to filter out messages containing stopwords from the "stopwords.txt" file.
Implement the MP3 coordination functionality:

Create buttons for the admin to control the MP3 playback.
Use a library like pygame or playsound to play the MP3 files.
Allow the admin to play, pause, and stop the MP3.
Allow the admin for file sharing or video streaming
Implement the admin's blocking functionality:

Create a list to store the blocked IP addresses.
Allow the admin to kick users and automatically add their IP addresses to the blocked list.
Store the blocked IP addresses in the "blocked_by_admin_IP-address.txt" file.
Implement the invitation feature:

Allow users to invite friends by entering their IP addresses.
Verify the entered IP addresses and add them to the live guests' list.
Implement additional standard features:

Add features like private messaging between ONLY admin and any user.
Implement user authentication to ensure only authorized users can access the chat.
Include a profanity filter to prevent offensive content in the chat.
Plan for future releases:

Collect feedback from users and identify areas for improvement.

Creating a complete implementation of the "Mask IP-address Chat Game Party" using Python's tkinter library and other relevant libraries like pygame or playsound for MP3 playback, as well as adding features like file sharing or video streaming, can be a complex project. Below is an outline to help you get started with the implementation. Please note that this outline provides a high-level overview, and you'll need to write the actual code for each step.

python
Copy code
import tkinter as tk
import pygame  # or import playsound
import socket
import os

# Initialize tkinter
root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Mask IP-address Chat Game Party")
root.geometry("800x600")

# Define variables to store IP addresses
host_ip = socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname())
guest_ips = []  # Store guest IP addresses
blocked_ips = []  # Store blocked IP addresses

# Create labels and text boxes for live hosts and guests
host_label = tk.Label(root, text=f"Host IP: {host_ip}")
host_label.pack()

guests_label = tk.Label(root, text="Guest IPs:")
guests_label.pack()

# Create labels to display IP addresses of guests who are not live
not_live_label = tk.Label(root, text="Guests who are not live:")
not_live_label.pack()

# Create a text box widget to display chat messages
chat_text = tk.Text(root, wrap=tk.WORD)
chat_text.pack()

# Create buttons for MP3 playback control
play_button = tk.Button(root, text="Play MP3")
pause_button = tk.Button(root, text="Pause MP3")
stop_button = tk.Button(root, text="Stop MP3")

play_button.pack()
pause_button.pack()
stop_button.pack()

# Implement admin's blocking functionality
block_button = tk.Button(root, text="Block User")
unblock_button = tk.Button(root, text="Unblock User")

block_button.pack()
unblock_button.pack()

# Implement invitation feature
invite_label = tk.Label(root, text="Enter IP address to invite:")
invite_entry = tk.Entry(root)
invite_button = tk.Button(root, text="Invite")

invite_label.pack()
invite_entry.pack()
invite_button.pack()

# Implement additional standard features
private_message_label = tk.Label(root, text="Private Message:")
private_message_entry = tk.Entry(root)
send_private_message_button = tk.Button(root, text="Send")

private_message_label.pack()
private_message_entry.pack()
send_private_message_button.pack()

# Implement user authentication
# You can use a username and password system here

# Implement profanity filter
# You can read a list of profanity words from a file and filter messages

# Plan for future releases
# Collect feedback and make improvements based on user input

# Main loop
root.mainloop()
This outline provides a starting point for your project. You'll need to add the actual logic for functionality such as handling chat messages, MP3 playback, blocking users, and more. Additionally, implementing user authentication and a profanity filter will require more in-depth code and potentially external libraries or resources.

Remember to install any necessary libraries, such as pygame or playsound, and handle any exceptions or error checking in your code for a robust application.ipchat.py
